<h3><a id="what_is_pagerank" name="what_is_pagerank"></a>Page Rank</h3>
<h3>Google page rank- 3/10</h3>
Page Rank is a numeric value that represents how sgnificant a page is on the web. Google finds that when one page links to another page, it casts a vote for the other page. More votes that a page accumulates, the more more important it becomes.&nbsp; Also, the importance of the page that is casting the vote determines how important the vote itself is. Google calculates a page's importance from the votes cast for it. When the page rank for a page is calculated you can determine the importance of the page. <br>
www.domain.com has a page rank 3. A website with page rank 3 or below is not much trusted by search engines. The ideal page rank should be 4 or higher.&nbsp; Websites with higher Page Rank are considered an authoritative source. High Page Rank can also improve Search Engine Results Page (SERP) performance.<br>
<br>
<h3>Keyword Density</h3>
<h4>domain- 3.5%</h4>
<h4>site- 2.9%</h4>
<h4>email-2.5%</h4>

<h3>Website Speed</h3>
<h4>Size- 32KB</h4>
<h4>Page Load Time- 0.96 seconds</h4>
<br>
The website speed report shows the duration that your website takes to load. Suppose your website's total size is 35.85 KB and it takes 1.36 seconds to load then the average speed of your website would be 0.04 seconds per KB. If your web site does not load in under 8 seconds on a dial-up connection (56k modem) then a large percentage of your website visitors will leave your site and access another that loads faster than yours. The speed of your website has a direct impact on the number of website visitors that convert into a sale or an enquiry. <br>
<br>
<h3>Back links</h3>
<h4>High quality- 20</h4>
<h4>All links- 80</h4>
Backlinks are also known as incoming links, inbound links, inlinks, and inward links. The number of backlinks is one indication of the popularity or importance of a website or page. Search engines often use the number of backlinks that a website has as one of the most important factors for determining that website's search engine ranking. Backlinks from authoritative sites, or sites that have a high page rank, on a given topic are highly valuable. If both sites have content geared toward the keyword topic, the backlink is considered relevant and believed to have strong influence on the search engine rankings of the webpage granted the backlink. <br>
<br>
